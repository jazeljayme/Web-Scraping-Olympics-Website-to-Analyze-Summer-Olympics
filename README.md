# Summer Olympics the Evolution: Going Strong Since 1896

<p align="justify">The Olympics has been around for more than a century, thus there is a multitude of data analyses and related literature available on the open web. The hype and support to this highly anticipated sports festival inspired the researchers to explore the Olympics data from 1896 and deep dive into its specific aspects -- hosting, participating countries, teams, athletes, sporting events, and the economic factors affecting the performance of the participants. As of the completion of this paper, it can be assumed that this would be one of the first reports that included and appended the data and insights on the Tokyo 2020/21 Olympics.</p>

<p align="justify">The data segmented into six tables in the Olympics SQL database were collected and created from scraping the Olympics official website and the Olympics Wikipedia pages. In order to analyze the data and to generate meaningful insights, several processes were performed-- data cleaning, exploration, analysis, and visualization. Supplementary sources were also utilized to verify or make sense of the key results discussed in section VI:</p>

<ul>
<li>Greece as the Olympics Games country of origin was likely the main reason that Europe totaled 16 over 29 hosting bids won.</li>
<li>The economic growth and superiority of a country were major influences in winning the Olympics hosting bid, e.g., Seoul, Beijing, and Tokyo as the only Asian countries hosted, and the USA for the most hosting bids.</li>
<li>The USA and China as powerful countries with high economic resources lead the ranking of the most gold medals won. An interesting contrast observed was the correlation of the wider wealth gap to better Olympics performance.</li>
<li>An overall upward trend has been observed in the number of participating countries, teams, athletes, and sporting events. A few dips or downward trends were attributed to several boycotts, public health concerns, and other political disruptions.</li>
<li>The participation of women athletes has also seen significant progress and led to a 50-50 male-to-female split in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The team agreed that further exploration is necessary to acquire actionable insights and recommendations. The way forward is to dig deeper into the following areas of interest that came to light during the initial data exploration: 1) the econometric analysis, specifically the correlations of the socio-economic indicators to the athletesâ€™ performance; 2) the economic impacts of the Olympics to the host countries, and the probability of middle economies to win the hosting bids; 3) the criteria of eligibility and selection of Olympics sports, and the likelihood of e-games to qualify as an Olympic sport, and lastly; 4) the possible relationship between gender plus physical features and Olympics winning chances.</p>
